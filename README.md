MySQL Projects

I have published here two MySQL projects that I did on my own.

Fisrt project was to create a Financial database consisting of 8 tables such as Accounts, Clients, Transactions. 
It required to create all 8 tables inside database with constraints, checks and keys.
Then to run certain SQL Queries to get desired Output, some of which required Joins and subqueries. 

Second Project was to download online dataset "TPC-H" and then load it into existing MYSQL server.
The task was to create 8 tables as defined in TPC-H dataset and insert all the rows and values.
Then perform required SQL queries to get desired dataset.
Second Task was to create certain views and temporary tables inside database and then perform queries using these views with existing tables.
